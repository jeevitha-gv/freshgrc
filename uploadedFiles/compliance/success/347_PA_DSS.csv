,,,2,"The resident Payment Application does not meet all PA-DSS Requirements, but the hardware on which the application resides is listed on the PCI SSC‘s Approved PIN Transaction Security (PTS) Devices List as a current PCI PTS approved Point of Interaction (POI) device. In this scenario, it may be possible for the application to satisfy PA-DSS Requirements through a combination of the PA-DSS and PTS validated controls",,
